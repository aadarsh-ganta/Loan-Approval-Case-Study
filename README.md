# Loan-Approval-Case-Study

This case study focuses on analyzing and optimizing loan approvals to maximize revenue by matching customer applications to the most suitable lenders. Utilizing Python, I calculated approval rates for three different lenders and explored correlations between important variables that impact loan approval outcomes while creating visualizations to derive actionable insights. The project aims to uncover trends in loan approvals and develop strategies to maximize lender revenue by identifying patterns in successful loan applications. 

Key Features:

Analyzed differences in customer profiles preferred by each lender

Identified key variables that predict loan approval likelihood

Maximized revenue per application by assigning customers to the most suitable lender

Explored real-time strategies for implementing lender matching.
